## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer coupling the problem-solving skills of a Chemical Engineer with the growth-mindset of a professional cricketer. My interest in technology became a passion when I learnt to harness the power of data to help uncover cricketing talent from non-traditional pathways. Having solidified my coding fundamentals with a Makers Academy Bootcamp and consolidated with an internship at Onyx Insight, I am raring to use my skills to help teammates and clients pursue their passion.
